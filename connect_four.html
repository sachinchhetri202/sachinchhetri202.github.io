                    <p>Connect Four is a classic two-player connection game in which players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.</p>
                    <p>I developed the core logic that allows players to drop discs into a grid, check for a winner, and handle turns between the two players. The win condition checks include horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections. The game board is styled for a clean and user-friendly experience.</p>
