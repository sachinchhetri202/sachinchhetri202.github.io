                    <p>This Banking App was a group project developed using Node.js and React, designed to handle secure transactions and user account management. The app includes features for deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, with specific user roles: Administrator, Employee, and Customer.</p>
                    <p>My specific contributions to the project included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Frontend Development:</strong> I developed key components such as the transaction history page, which displays all transaction histories, and the balances page, which shows the current balances for different accounts. I ensured these pages were user-friendly and visually consistent with the overall design.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Fetching and Session Management:</strong> I worked on fetching data from the backend and handling session management, ensuring that user data was accurately retrieved and securely handled.</li>
                        <li><strong>Navigation and UI Enhancements:</strong> I made corrections to page navigation and small UI changes to improve user experience and ensure smooth transitions between different sections of the app.</li>
