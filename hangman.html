                    <p>Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to uncover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. This version of Hangman was a group project where I collaborated with others to develop the game.</p>
                    <p>My contributions included integrating the user interface with the backend logic, ensuring that guessed letters were correctly handled and displayed, and managing the game state transitions. The game provides a fun and challenging experience, where the player must guess the word before the character gets "hanged."</p>
